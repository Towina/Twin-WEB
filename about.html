<div id="about-intro">
<p>Hi! My name is Ana Baranjin, a person behind TWIN that breathes and lives creativity. I truly believe design and illustration can transform lives in core through ability to simplify meaning and big words, provide clear visual communication, and engage people in causes through inspiration called alltogether - art.
<br>
<br>As an educated marketing graduate with years od experience, I strive to know all the little things before starting on a project, things that don’t make finished products just “pretty and cute,” but functional in relation to the target audiences, goals of the company, while staying mindful that the presentation of the project is visible on all the devices and products it will be placed on.
<br>
<br>Communication is the key to successful projects and art itself is more of a “beauty in the eye of beholder.” Because of that, as an
university educated professional with experience I try to recommend the best couse of action, while keeping in mind the client’s desires and changes they may have, by not being a “pizza order” business but rather colaborating with the client.
<br>
<br>As you might have noticed, all the sections on the homepage say something about my skills as an artist but also some of my hobbies. I love scubadiving, mountain-climbing, skiing (and all the snow sports), biking, roller-blading,  and so on. And I do have a twin sister!
<br>
<br>That is me, now tell me about you and your project so we can create something beautiful together! :)
